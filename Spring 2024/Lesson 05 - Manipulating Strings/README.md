# Manipulating Strings

## Getting Started

### Poetry

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. To install Poetry, run the following
command:

```shell
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python -
```

Once Poetry is installed, you can install the project dependencies by running the following command:

```shell
poetry install
```

### Lesson Summary

This lesson will introduce the concept of strings in programming. Students will learn about the syntax for creating
strings and how to use common string methods, such as `upper()`, `lower()`, and `isupper()`. Students will also learn
about the differences between string and list data types and how to use slicing to extract substrings from strings.
Finally, students will learn about the importance of input validation in programming and how to use regular expressions
to ensure that user inputs are valid.

### Learning Objectives
- **Explore Advanced String Manipulation:** Learn techniques beyond simple string concatenation, including extracting
  partial strings, manipulating spacing, and converting cases. Understand how to utilize Python string methods to
  perform various text-processing tasks.
- **Implement Clipboard Automation:** Develop the ability to access the clipboard using Python code. Create a simple
  clipboard program that can store and manage multiple strings of text.
- **Automate Text Formatting:** Work through programming projects involving the automation of text formatting tasks.
  Apply string manipulation techniques to streamline the process of handling and formatting pieces of text efficiently.
- **Understand the Power of Text-Based Programs:** Recognize the effectiveness of text-based programs in manipulating
  large amounts of data quickly. Explore the advantages of working with text-based programs for tasks that may not
  involve graphical user interfaces or flashy visuals.
