# Working with Excel Spreadsheets

## Getting Started

### Poetry

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. To install Poetry, run the following
command:

```shell
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python -
```

Once Poetry is installed, you can install the project dependencies by running the following command:

```shell
poetry install
```

### Lesson Summary

This lesson will introduce the concept of spreadsheets in programming. Students will learn about the importance of
spreadsheets in organizing data and how to use the `openpyxl` module to read and write to spreadsheets. Students will
also learn about the importance of spreadsheet automation in programming and how to use the `openpyxl` module to
automate spreadsheet tasks. Finally, students will learn about the importance of spreadsheet handling in programming and
how to use the `openpyxl` module to handle spreadsheets.

### Learning Objectives
- **Understanding the Challenges in Data Processing:** Recognize that the difficulty in processing information often
  lies in formatting data appropriately for programmatic manipulation. Understand the importance of efficient data
  processing for enhancing program functionality.
- **Exploring Python's Role in Spreadsheet Handling:** Learn about the openpyxl module and its significance in loading
  and manipulating spreadsheets within Python. Understand the advantages of using Python for extracting and manipulating
  data from spreadsheets.
- **Leveraging Python for Spreadsheet Automation:** Gain practical skills in automating spreadsheet tasks using Python,
  such as copying and pasting data, making edits based on criteria, and searching for specific information in multiple
  spreadsheets. Recognize the efficiency gains achieved by using Python to perform repetitive and mindless spreadsheet
  tasks.
