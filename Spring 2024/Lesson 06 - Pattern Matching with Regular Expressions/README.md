# Pattern Matching with Regular Expressions

## Getting Started

### Poetry

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. To install Poetry, run the following
command:

```shell
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python -
```

Once Poetry is installed, you can install the project dependencies by running the following command:

```shell
poetry install
```

### Learning Objectives
- **Introduction to Regular Expressions:** Define regular expressions and understand their role in text pattern
  searching. Differentiate between traditional text search methods (e.g., CTRL-F) and the advanced capabilities offered
  by regular expressions.
- **Recognizing Text Patterns:** Identify common text patterns in various contexts, such as phone numbers, email
  addresses, social security numbers, URLs, and hashtags. Understand how regular expressions can be used to describe and
  search for these patterns efficiently.
- **Mastering Basic Regular Expression Features:** Learn the basics of matching with regular expressions, including
  specifying character patterns. Explore the power of regular expressions in simplifying code for finding text patterns.
- **Advanced Regular Expression Techniques:** Understand advanced features of regular expressions, such as string
  substitution and creating custom character classes. Apply regular expressions to perform complex text processing tasks
  efficiently.
