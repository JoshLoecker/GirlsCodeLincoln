# Lists

## Getting Started

### Poetry

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. To install Poetry, run the following
command:

```shell
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python -
```

Once Poetry is installed, you can install the project dependencies by running the following command:

```shell
poetry install
```

### Lesson Summary

This lesson will introduce the concept of lists in programming. Students will learn about the syntax for creating lists
and how to use common list methods, such as `append()` and `remove()`. Students will also learn about the differences
between mutable and immutable sequence data types and how to use `copy()` and `deepcopy()` for managing list changes
without affecting other variables.

### Learning Objectives
- **Understand the Basics of Lists:** Define lists in programming as ordered sequences. Recognize the syntax for
  creating a list and distinguish the "list value" from its internal values.
- **Explore List Methods:** Define methods in programming and their connection to specific data types. Explore and use
  common list methods, such as append() and remove().
- **Compare Sequence Data Types:** Differentiate mutable and immutable sequence data types. Compare lists, tuples, and
  strings, highlighting their unique characteristics and use cases.
- **Grasp the Importance of List References:** Explain that variables store references, not list values directly.
  Introduce the use of `copy()` and `deepcopy()` for managing list changes without affecting other variables.
