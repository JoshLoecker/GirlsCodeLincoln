# Sending Email and Text Messages

## Getting Started

### Poetry

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. To install Poetry, run the following
command:

```shell
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python -
```

Once Poetry is installed, you can install the project dependencies by running the following command:

```shell
poetry install
```

### Lesson Summary

This lesson will introduce the concept of email and text messages in programming. Students will learn about the
importance of email and text messages in automating communication and how to use the `ezgmail` module to send and read
emails. Students will also learn about the importance of email and text messages in automating communication and how to
use the `ezgmail` module to send and read emails. Finally, students will learn about the importance of email and text
messages in automating communication and how to use the `ezgmail` module to send and read emails.

### Learning Objectives
- **Email Automation Proficiency:** Gain a comprehensive understanding of the EZGmail module for sending and reading
  emails from Gmail accounts using Python. Learn to utilize Python's smtplib, imapclient, and pyzmail modules for
  interacting with standard SMTP and IMAP email protocols. Develop the skills to automate email-related tasks, such as
  sending personalized emails based on data from spreadsheets. Explore techniques for handling security and spam
  precautions when accessing email services, especially with a focus on using the EZGmail module for Gmail API
  integration.
- **SMS Notification Implementation:** Acquire the knowledge to integrate SMS notification features into Python programs
  using services like Twilio. Understand the setup process for sending text messages from programs, including the
  necessary modules and initial configurations. Explore scenarios where SMS notifications are beneficial, such as
  receiving program status updates while away from the computer. Develop proficiency in writing code to trigger SMS
  notifications based on specific conditions, enhancing the overall functionality and user experience of Python
  programs.
- **Cross-Program Communication via Email:** Learn how Python programs can communicate directly with each other through
  email using SMTP and IMAP protocols. Understand the differences between SMTP and IMAP protocols, and their respective
  roles in sending and retrieving emails. Explore the potential for cross-computer communication by writing programs
  that exchange information via email. Develop skills in searching for, downloading, and parsing emails to extract
  relevant information, expanding the capabilities of Python programs beyond individual systems.
