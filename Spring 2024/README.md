**<p style="text-align: center;">Python Programming for Automation</p>**
<p style="text-align: center;">Josh Loecker - Spring 2024</p>

**Objective:** The semester-long course aims to introduce middle school students to the world of programming through
Python. Emphasizing hands-on group work, problem-solving using online resources, and culminating in ~1 project per week,
the curriculum is designed to make learning Python engaging and applicable. Throughout this course, I would love for
groups to be able to work at their own pace, asking for help from volunteers as they get stuck. I’m hoping this will
limit the amount of “boredom” from students more proficient at programming and less stress/frustration from those who
need more help. The timeline listed below is a general guideline, and does not need to be followed exactly.

**Weeks 1-2:** Control Flow

[Google Slides Link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/107A5EaseG4CJ8u-WYYzv9BwloNFcO5I8ZIZdcKmb5ts/edit?usp=sharing)<br>

**Learning Objectives:**

- Understand the concept of control flow in programming.
- Learn how to use if statements, loops, and functions in Python.
- Apply control flow concepts to create a rock/paper/scissors game.

**General Program Guide:**

- The computer will make a random choice (rock/paper/scissors).
- The programmer will code each possible outcome.
- The possible outcomes are:

| User Chooses | Computer Chooses |   Result   |
|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------:|
|     Rock     |       Rock       |    Tie     |
|     Rock     |      Paper       | User Loses |
|     Rock     |     Scissors     | User Wins  |
|    Paper     |       Rock       | User Wins  |
|    Paper     |      Paper       |    Tie     |
|    Paper     |     Scissors     | User Loses |
|   Scissors   |       Rock       | User Loses |
|   Scissors   |      Paper       | User Wins  |
|   Scissors   |     Scissors     |    Tie     |
