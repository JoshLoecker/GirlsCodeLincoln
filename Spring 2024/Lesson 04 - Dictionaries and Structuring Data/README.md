# Dictionaries and Structuring Data

## Getting Started

### Poetry

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. To install Poetry, run the following
command:

```shell
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python -
```

Once Poetry is installed, you can install the project dependencies by running the following command:

```shell
poetry install
```

### Lesson Summary

This lesson will introduce the concept of dictionaries in programming. Students will learn about the syntax for creating
dictionaries and how to use common dictionary methods, such as `keys()`, `values()`, and `items()`. Students will also
learn about the differences between lists and dictionaries and how to use a combination of the two for modeling
real-world objects. Finally, students will learn about the importance of data validation in programming and how to use
if statements to ensure that user inputs are valid

### Learning Objectives
- **Master the Dictionary Data Type:** Define the dictionary data type and its role in organizing and accessing data.
  Understand the concept of key-value pairs in dictionaries. Identify the various data types that can serve as keys in
  dictionaries.
- **Compare Lists and Dictionaries:** Contrast the differences between lists and dictionaries in terms of structure and
  functionality. Recognize the advantages of using dictionaries, particularly in mapping one item to another, compared
  to the sequential nature of lists.
- **Apply Dictionaries in Data Modeling:** Explore how dictionaries can be effectively combined with lists to create
  complex data structures. Develop the ability to model real-world objects using dictionaries, enhancing program
  representation.
- **Hands-On: Create a Tic-Tac-Toe Data Structure:** Apply knowledge of dictionaries and lists to create a data
  structure for modeling a tic-tac-toe board. Understand the advantages of using a combination of dictionaries and lists
  for organizing complex game-related data.
