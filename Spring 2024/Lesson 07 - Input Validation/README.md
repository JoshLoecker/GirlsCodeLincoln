# Input Validation

## Getting Started

### Poetry

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. To install Poetry, run the following
command:

```shell
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python -
```

Once Poetry is installed, you can install the project dependencies by running the following command:

```shell
poetry install
```

# Lesson Summary

This lesson will introduce the concept of input validation in programming. Students will learn about the importance of
input validation in preventing nonsensical or incorrect user inputs. Students will also learn how to implement basic
input validation code using a while loop. Finally, students will learn about the challenges of manual input validation
and how to use try and except statements to make their programs more robust.

### Learning Objectives
- **Understanding the Importance of Input Validation:** Recognize the significance of input validation in preventing
  nonsensical or incorrect user inputs. Understand how input validation contributes to code robustness, bug prevention,
  and security.
- **Implementing Basic Input Validation Code:** Learn the fundamentals of input validation through a basic example using
  a while loop. Understand the key components of input validation code, such as type conversion, exception handling, and
  conditional statements.
- **Exploring Challenges with Manual Input Validation:** Identify potential challenges and drawbacks of manually
  implementing input validation for every input() call in a program. Understand the limitations and the risk of
  overlooking certain cases in manual input validation.
