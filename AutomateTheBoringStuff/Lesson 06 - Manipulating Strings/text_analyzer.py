Create a function called 'textAnalyzer' that accepts a string called 'text' as an argument
    Print the number of characters in the string using the 'len' function
    Print the number of words in the string using the 'split()' function
    Print the average number of words per character in the string by dividing the number of words by the number of characters


Use the following strings to test your function:
textAnalyzer("This is a test string")
textAnalyzer("This is a test string with more words")
