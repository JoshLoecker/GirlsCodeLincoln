### Lesson Summary

This lesson will introduce the concept of web scraping in programming. Students will learn about the importance of web
scraping in automating web-based tasks and how to use the `webbrowser` module to open web pages. Students will also
learn about the importance of web requests in downloading web pages and how to use the `requests` module to download web
pages. Finally, students will learn about the importance of HTML parsing in extracting information from web pages and
how to use the `BeautifulSoup` module to parse HTML.

### Learning Objectives
- **Recognizing the Significance of Web Scraping:** Understand the importance of web scraping in programming, especially
  when much of computer work involves internet-related tasks. Recognize the value of extending programs to access and
  process content from the web.
- **Exploring Essential Modules for Web Scraping:** Learn about key Python modules for web scraping, including
  webbrowser, requests, bs4 (Beautiful Soup), and selenium. Understand the functionalities provided by each module, such
  as opening a browser, downloading files and web pages, parsing HTML, and controlling web browsers.
- **Hands-On Application of Web Scraping Techniques:** Gain practical experience in using web scraping modules for
  common tasks, such as downloading web pages, parsing HTML content, and controlling web browsers. Explore the requests
  module for straightforward downloads and the BeautifulSoup module for parsing downloaded pages with basic HTML
  concepts and selectors. Understand the role of the selenium module in fully automating web-based tasks, including
  logging in to websites and filling out forms automatically.
