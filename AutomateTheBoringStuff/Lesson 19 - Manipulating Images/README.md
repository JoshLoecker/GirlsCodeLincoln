# Manipulating Images

## Getting Started

### Poetry

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. To install Poetry, run the following
command:

```shell
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python -
```

Once Poetry is installed, you can install the project dependencies by running the following command:

```shell
poetry install
```

### Lesson Summary

This lesson will introduce the concept of images in programming. Students will learn about the importance of images in
automating image editing tasks and how to use the `Pillow` module to edit images. Students will also learn about the
importance of images in automating image editing tasks and how to use the `Pillow` module to edit images. Finally,
students will learn about the importance of images in automating image editing tasks and how to use the `Pillow` module
to edit images.

### Learning Objectives
- **Introduction to Image Processing with Python and Pillow:** Understand the significance of automating image editing
  tasks for efficiency. Learn about the Pillow module, a third-party Python library, and its role in interacting with
  digital image files. Gain knowledge of the functions provided by Pillow for tasks such as cropping, resizing, and
  editing the content of images. Acquire the skills to install the Pillow module using pip and understand the versioning
  considerations.
- **Basic Concepts of Image Representation and Manipulation:** Comprehend the fundamental concepts of digital images,
  including pixels, RGBA values, and x- and y-coordinates. Explore common image formats, such as JPEG and PNG, and
  understand how the pillow module can handle these formats. Learn about the Image object in Pillow, including how it
  stores dimensions and supports methods for image manipulations. Gain proficiency in using methods like crop(), copy(),
  paste(), resize(), rotate(), and transpose() for common image operations.
- **Advanced Image Editing and Drawing with Pillow:** Explore advanced image editing capabilities provided by Pillow,
  including drawing shapes like points, lines, rectangles, ellipses, and polygons. Understand how to draw text onto an
  image with customizable typeface and font size using Pillow's ImageDraw methods. Learn the process of saving edited
  images using the save() method of the Image object. Recognize the cost-effective alternative Python offers for batch
  processing of images, highlighting the capabilities of Python scripts in comparison to expensive applications like
  Photoshop.
