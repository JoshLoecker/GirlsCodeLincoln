# Organizing Files

## Getting Started

### Poetry

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. To install Poetry, run the following
command:

```shell
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python -
```

Once Poetry is installed, you can install the project dependencies by running the following command:

```shell
poetry install
```

### Lesson Summary

This lesson will introduce the concept of file organization in programming. Students will learn about the importance of
automating file organization tasks and how to use the `shutil` module to automate file copying, renaming, moving, and
compressing. Students will also learn about the importance of file extensions in identifying file types and how to view
file extensions on different operating systems and file browsers. Finally, students will learn about the importance of
writing robust file handling code and how to use the `logging` module to log error messages to a file.

### Learning Objectives
- **Automating File Organization:** Understand the benefits of automating file organization tasks in Python. Recognize
  scenarios where automating file copying, renaming, moving, and compressing can significantly improve efficiency.
- **Exploring Common File Organization Tasks:** Identify common file organization tasks, such as copying specific file
  types, renaming files in bulk, and compressing multiple folders into a ZIP file. Understand the potential time savings
  and accuracy improvements achieved through automation.
- **Introduction to File Extensions:** Understand the concept of file extensions and their role in identifying file
  types. Learn how to view file extensions on different operating systems and file browsers.
- **Best Practices in File Handling Code:** Learn best practices for writing file handling code, including commenting
  out potentially risky operations and using print() calls for verification. Understand the importance of testing and
  verifying file handling code before executing potentially irreversible operations.
- **Preparing for Code Analysis and Debugging:** Acknowledge that writing perfect programs is a rare occurrence and that
  debugging is a crucial part of the programming process. Anticipate the next chapter's focus on Python modules that aid
  in code analysis and debugging for improving program correctness.
