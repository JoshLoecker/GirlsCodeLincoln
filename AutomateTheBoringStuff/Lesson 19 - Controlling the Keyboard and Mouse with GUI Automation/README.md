# Controlling the Keyboard and Mouse with GUI Automation

## Getting Started

### Poetry

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. To install Poetry, run the following
command:

```shell
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python -
```

Once Poetry is installed, you can install the project dependencies by running the following command:

```shell
poetry install
```

automation in automating tasks on a computer and how to use the `PyAutoGUI` module to automate GUI tasks. Students will
also learn about the importance of GUI automation in automating tasks on a computer and how to use the `PyAutoGUI`
module to automate GUI tasks. Finally, students will learn about the importance of GUI automation in automating tasks
on a computer and how to use the `PyAutoGUI` module to automate GUI tasks.

### Learning Objectives
- **Understanding GUI Automation with Python and PyAutoGUI:** Recognize the significance of GUI automation in automating
  tasks on a computer. Understand the concept of graphical user interface (GUI) automation and its role in controlling
  keyboard and mouse actions programmatically. Learn about PyAutoGUI as a Python module for GUI automation and its
  capabilities in simulating mouse movements, clicks, keyboard inputs, and more. Explore the advantages of GUI
  automation, especially for tasks involving repetitive clicking or form filling.
- **Exploring PyAutoGUI Functions and Features:** Gain proficiency in using PyAutoGUI functions to move the mouse
  cursor, simulate mouse clicks, and execute keyboard inputs. Understand the capabilities of PyAutoGUI in checking
  screen colors and obtaining information about the screen contents. Learn how PyAutoGUI can analyze a screenshot to
  determine coordinates for specific areas on the screen. Explore the limitations and considerations when writing GUI
  automation programs, with a focus on preventing errors and ensuring robustness.
- **Creating Efficient and Repetitive Task Automation with PyAutoGUI:** Develop practical skills in combining PyAutoGUI
  features to automate repetitive tasks on a computer. Understand the hypnotic and satisfying aspects of watching the
  mouse cursor move autonomously and text appear on the screen during automation. Learn best practices for writing GUI
  automation programs that crash quickly in case of bad instructions, ensuring efficient error handling. Explore the
  potential time-saving benefits of using PyAutoGUI to delegate tedious and repetitive work, allowing users to focus on
  more engaging and creative aspects of their responsibilities.
