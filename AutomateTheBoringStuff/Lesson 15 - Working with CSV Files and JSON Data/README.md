# Working with CSV Files and JSON Data

## Getting Started

### Poetry

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. To install Poetry, run the following
command:

```shell
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python -
```

Once Poetry is installed, you can install the project dependencies by running the following command:

```shell
poetry install
```

### Lesson Summary

This lesson will introduce the concept of CSV and JSON data in programming. Students will learn about the importance of
CSV and JSON data in organizing data and how to use the `csv` and `json` modules to read and write to CSV and JSON
files. Students will also learn about the importance of CSV and JSON data automation in programming and how to use the
`csv` and `json` modules to automate CSV and JSON data tasks. Finally, students will learn about the importance of CSV
and JSON data handling in programming and how to use the `csv` and `json` modules to handle CSV and JSON data.

### Learning Objectives
- **Understanding CSV and JSON as Plaintext File Formats:** Recognize CSV as an acronym for "comma-separated values" and
  understand that CSV files store simplified spreadsheets as plaintext. Grasp the concept that JSON (JavaScript Object
  Notation) stores information in JavaScript source code in plaintext files, making it a common format in web
  applications.
- **Exploring Python's csv and json Modules:** Learn about Python's csv module, designed for parsing and handling CSV
  files, and understand its functions. Explore the json module in Python, which simplifies the process of reading and
  writing to JSON files, and comprehend its usage.
- **Parsing Data from Common Plaintext Formats:** Understand the significance of CSV and JSON as common plaintext
  formats for storing data, facilitating easy parsing by programs while remaining human-readable. Acknowledge the role
  of the csv and json modules in Python in simplifying the handling of data stored in CSV and JSON file formats.
