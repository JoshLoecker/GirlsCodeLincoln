# Working with PDF and Word Documents

## Getting Started

### Poetry

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. To install Poetry, run the following
command:

```shell
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python -
```

Once Poetry is installed, you can install the project dependencies by running the following command:

```shell
poetry install
```

### Lesson Summary

This lesson will introduce the concept of PDF and Word documents in programming. Students will learn about the
importance of PDF and Word documents in organizing data and how to use the `PyPDF2` and `python-docx` modules to read
and write to PDF and Word documents. Students will also learn about the importance of PDF and Word document automation
in programming and how to use the `PyPDF2` and `python-docx` modules to automate PDF and Word document tasks. Finally,
students will learn about the importance of PDF and Word document handling in programming and how to use the `PyPDF2`
and `python-docx` modules to handle PDF and Word documents.

### Learning Objectives
- **Exploring Python Modules for PDF and Word Interaction:** Learn about Python modules, PyPDF2, and python-docx,
  designed to facilitate interaction with PDFs and Word documents, respectively. Understand the importance of using
  these modules for more than basic file operations, considering the complexity of the file formats.
- **Utilizing PyPDF2 for PDF Document Manipulation:** Explore the functionality provided by the PyPDF2 module for
  reading and writing PDF documents in Python. Acknowledge the potential challenges in reading text from PDFs due to the
  intricate PDF file format and the limitations of PyPDF2.
- **Understanding the Complexity of PDF and Word Documents:** Recognize that PDF and Word documents are binary files
  with additional complexity compared to plaintext files. Understand that these files store not only text but also font,
  color, and layout information, requiring specialized handling in Python.
