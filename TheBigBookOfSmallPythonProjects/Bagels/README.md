# Bagels

**A deductive logic game where you must guess a number based on clues.**

`Bagels` is a deductive logic game where you must guess a number based on clues. A
clue is given by the computer in the form of the number of digits that are correct,
but not their position in the sequence.

For example, if the secret number is `248` and your guess is `843`, then the clue
would be `1 bagel` (1 digit is correct but in the wrong position).

The game ends when the user guesses the correct number.
