Each semester-long course aims to introduce middle school students to the world of programming through Python. Emphasizing hands-on group work, problem-solving using online resources, and culminating in ~1 project per week, the curriculum is designed to make learning Python engaging and applicable. Throughout each semester, I would love for enough content to be made before-hand so groups are able to work at their own pace, asking for help from volunteers as they get stuck. I’m hoping this will limit the amount of “boredom” from students more proficient at programming and less stress/frustration from those who need more help and would otherwise be left behind. The timelines listed each each semester's overview is a general guideline and does not need to be followed exactly.
